# Policy Playground
## Guha Mahesh, Sota Shimizu, Bhuvan Hospet, Carter Vargas

Welcome to Policy Playground by Pushin' Policy! Our app is designed to empower individuals working with economic public policy by providing data-driven insights to support the legislative process.

Through interactive fiscal and monetary tools, users can explore and predict key economic indicators such as the S&P 500 and GDP. Policy Playground also offers access to historical policy data, politicians’ records, and their associated economic impacts—helping economists, lobbyists, and policymakers make informed decisions with confidence.


## Our tools include:

- AI Models to predict Currency Exchange Rates, Market Indicators such as the SPY or the FTSE, and the GDP/Capita of a country based off of fiscal and monetary policy.
- Policy saving and publishing features for politicians to test out policies and save their favorite "presets" or publish policies to receive feedback from Economists
- Note taking features for Lobbyists to keep track of their conversations with politicians and view the politicians proposed policies and their implications
- Pages for Economists to view historic policies and information regarding how the policy was carried out, when the policies were made, and what the policies accomplished
- Additionally, Economists can also utilize a model which shows them similar policies to the historic policies they have saved

## Deploying the project

## How to use:
